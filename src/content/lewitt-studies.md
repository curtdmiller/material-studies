title: 'Sol Lewitt Studies'
---

A series of "transcriptions" of works by Sol Lewitt: an exhibition poster from 1974 and a few of his wall drawings.

Lewitt's study of the permutations of the possible open cubes becomes an exercise in a series of interactive SVG drawings created in JS and his interest in the space of the gallery wall becomes a study of the space of the browser with a focus on the section of the screen drawn by the browser as a surface rather than a "window" or "document".
